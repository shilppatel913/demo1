*working with repositories:

1)create a new rep
2)create remote in your gitbash: refer from github while making rep
3)create ssh key in order to get access to the rep you have created from gitbash
4) git push -u origin master 

*creating aliases: git config --global alias.st 'status'

creating a branch other than master branch:
git checkout -b branchname

to switch branches:
git checkout branchname(should exist)

to merge branches:
git merge branchname



solving merge conflict:
vs code gives you an option to choose which modificatons you want

to show merged branches:
git branch --merged
 
 for non merged branches:
 git branch --no-merged


 to add a remote:
 git remote remotename

 to push files on github:
 git push -u remotename master

 to add branch on github:
 git push -u origin1 branchname

 to delete a branch on github:
 git push -d origin1 branchname
