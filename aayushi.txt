the most beautiful soul in this world 
sherlock to my charles magnussen
you are selfless to a nauseating degree,i dont understand how could someone like me
could be with someone like you
you have taken care of me all along and i dont seem to find a way to repay you with honor 
i think this is my punishement to be away from you
